# Web Chat
This is a simple AJAX chatroom package using a flatfile.  

## Installing
Just upload the files to your webserver. No need to configure SQL databases or anything like that. All you need is a webserver with PHP installed.

## TODO
* Get rid of index.php and allow people to embed the chat to any page
* Some sort of BBCode or Markdown formatting.
* IRC-like commands (/ban, /rules, /topic, etc.)
* Admin control panel
* Actual user accounts with ranks (standard user, moderator, admin)
